# Savings Manager

The "Savings Manager" helps you manage your savings. With the use of virtual accounts, budgets can be allocated for various goals, and this process is entirely automated.

By setting a fixed monthly savings amount, you can determine the maximum amount that can be saved across the system each month. Desired savings amounts for each moneybox and upper savings limits allow the monthly savings to be automatically distributed across the moneyboxes at the beginning of each month. By setting fixed priorities, you can achieve a savings strategy that helps you reach certain savings goals faster than others.

A key feature is that if you withdraw a certain amount from a moneybox, the priority list of moneyboxes will automatically adjust to ensure that the emptied moneybox is quickly refilled.

This makes saving easy, allowing you to watch as each moneybox is gradually replenished. Of course, amounts can be transferred between the moneyboxes, and manual deposits into the moneyboxes are always possible!

## Deployment / Contribution

### Docker
1. Navigate to the Docker directory: `cd docker`
2. Run: `docker compose up -d` to start the PostgreSQL database and the Savings Manager app.  
   The app will be accessible at: `localhost:8000`

   - SwaggerUI: `localhost:8000/docs`
   - Sphinx: `localhost:8000/sphinx`

To get the latest version of the repository, simply pull it and rebuild the Docker container:  
`docker compose up --build`

### Manually

#### Poetry

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is used as the deployment and dependency manager.

##### Linux (Ubuntu 22.04):
1. Install Python 3.11 on your OS and add Python 3.11 to PATH.
2. Install pipx: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install pipx`
3. Install Poetry: `pipx install poetry --python 311`
4. Install project dependencies:  
   ```bash
   cd PROJECT_ROOT
   poetry install



##### Database
A PostgreSQL database is required. To connect to the database, add a `.env` file in `/src/envs` with the following information:

```
DB_DRIVER=postgresql+asyncpg
DB_NAME=savings_manager

DB_HOST=     [YOUR_HOSTADDRESS]
DB_PORT=     [YOUR_POSTGRES_DB_PORT]
DB_USER=     [YOUR_POSTGRES_DB_USER]
DB_PASSWORD= [YOUR_POSTGRES_DB_PASSWORD]


# smtp - the outgoing SMTP email server data
# -> SMTP_METHOD: only STARTTLS and TLS supported
SMTP_SERVER=
SMTP_PORT=
SMTP_METHOD=
SMTP_USER_NAME=
SMTP_PASSWORD=
```

Example:
```
DB_DRIVER=postgresql+asyncpg
DB_NAME=savings_manager
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres

# smtp - the outgoing SMTP email server data
# -> SMTP_METHOD: only STARTTLS and TLS supported
SMTP_SERVER=
SMTP_PORT=
SMTP_METHOD=
SMTP_USER_NAME=
SMTP_PASSWORD=
```
The SMTP settings will be explained later.

###### SqlAlchemy (ORM)
We will use SQLAlchemy to manage and access the SQL database.

To create and migrate the database tables, use Alembic with the following command:
From the project root directory:
`poetry run alembic upgrade head`

**Note: The database must be reachable.**

## CI/CD

[GitHub Workflows](https://github.com/PythBuster/savings_manager/actions/new) is uses as CI/CD pipeline.

[Github Action](https://github.com/PythBuster/savings_manager/actions/new) Items:
- poetry build --> TODO
- pytest check --> TODO
- codestyle check --> TODO

## Code Documentation
Based on docstrings, sphinx will generate function documentation.

### Usage:

#### 1. Create rst Files base on current project:

In dir: `../sphinx` use command: `sphinx-apidoc -f -o source/ ../../src`

#### 2. Create HTML documentation:

In dir: `../sphinx` use command: `sphinx-build source build`

For detailed description, see: [Generating documentation from docstring using Sphinx](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63486612/generating-documentation-from-docstring-using-sphinx)

An update sphinx documentation bash script is located in dir `script/`.
It will automatically update the sphinx documentation.


## DEV

### Alembic (Migration)


#### Init:
In our case, alembic already exists and don't need to be initialized.
Just for documentation: `alembic init -t async alembic` in project root dir will initialize an alembic environment.

#### Migration:
**Upgrade to a revision:**

*head (latest revision):* `alembic upgrade head`

*specific revision*: `alembic upgrade revision_id`

**Downgrade to a revision:**

*specific revision*: `alembic downgrade revision_id`

*specific revision (relative)*: `alembic downgrade head-1`

**Create new migration:**

`alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Added account table"`

# RUN

## .env file:We will use SqlAlchemy to manage and access the SQL database. 

To create and migrate the database tables, you need to use alembic 
by using the command:
In project root dir `poetry run alembic upgrade head`

**Hint**: The database must be reachable.
Savings Manager v2 is able to email you after automated savings is done.

If you want to receiver an email you have to use your email outgoing SMTP server, so the app will be able to send you an email.
You can obtain the outgoing SMTP email server data from your provider.

To use the email sender of the app, you need to add the smtp data in `/envs/.env`, like:

```# smtp - the outgoing SMTP email server data
# -> SMTP_METHOD: only STARTTLS and TLS supported
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.web.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_METHOD=STARTTLS
SMTP_USER_NAME=your.email@address.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-email-password
```

**Note: make sure that only you have access to your .env file !!!** 

## Run savings manager in python environment:
If poetry environment is initialized and all dependencies are initially installed
via:
- for production (usage only): `poetry install --without dev`
- for development: `poetry install`

you should be able to start the app from root directory of the project by using the following command:
`poetry run python -m src.main`


This will start a service on:
`http://localhost:8001`

To see the API documentation or use the API via SwaggerUI, visit:
`http://localhost:8001/docs`


## Run savings manager as docker:
ou can start the Savings Manager as a Docker container. After cloning the main repository and adding/adapting your `.env` file in `savings_manager/envs/`, you will be able to start the Docker service using the following command:

Navigate to `savings_manager/docker` and run:
`docker compose up --build -d` 
This will rebuild your container if necessary and start the container as a daemon (in the background).

Alternatively you can use the `START_SAVINGS_MANAGER.sh` script to start the savings manager into as a Docker container:
Navigate to `savings_manager/scripts` and run:
`./START_SAVINGS_MANAGER.sh`

(in windows, run the .bat file)

The savings manager into the docker will run on port 64000 and you will reach the servcie at: http://localhost:64000

API documentation: http://localhost:64000/docs
Code documentation: http://localhost:64000/sphinx
